# Self-driving Car (Keras)

Implementation of a simple virtual self-driving car using Udacity's self-driving car simulator. The model for the car is built using Keras, and it is trained on data that I generated by manually driving a virtual car using Udacity's simulator. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network that takes as its input the pixels from the simulator screen and decides what to do next based on its current state in the world.

## Dependencies

- Udacity's [self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
- [Keras](https://keras.io/).
