# Self-driving Car (Keras)

Implementation of a simple virtual self-driving car using Udacity's self-driving car simulator.

The actual model is built using Keras, and it is trained on data that I generated by manually driving a virtual car using Udacity's simulator.

## Dependencies

- Udacity's [self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
- [Keras](https://keras.io/).
